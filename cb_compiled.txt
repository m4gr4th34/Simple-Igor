leslie stephen, "an agnostic's apology", fortnightly review, 1876 . till then we shall be content to admit openly, what you (religionists) whisper under your breath or hide in technical jargon, that the ancient secret is a secret still; that man knows nothing of the infinite and absolute; and that, knowing nothing, he had better not be dogmatic about his ignorance-dd- and, meanwhile, we will endeavour to be as charitable as possible, and whilst you trumpet forth officially your contempt for our skepticism, we will at least try to believe that you are imposed upon by your own bluster-dd- - leslie stephen, "an agnostic's apology", fortnightly review, 1876 . marriage is the only adventure open to the cowardly-dd- - voltaire . what is tolerance-qq- -- it is the consequence of humanity-dd- we are all formed of frailty and error; let us pardon reciprocally each other's folly -- that is the first law of nature-dd- - voltaire . it is clear that the individual who persecutes a man, his brother, because he is not of the same opinion, is a monster-dd- - voltaire . i simply try to aid in letting the light of historical truth into that decaying mass of outworn thought which attaches the modern world to medieval conceptions of christianity, and which still lingers among us -- a most serious barrier to religion and morals, and a menace to the whole normal evolution of society-dd- - andrew d-dd- white, author, first president of cornell university, 1896 . the man scarce lives who is not more credulous than he ought to be-dd--dd--dd--dd- the natural disposition is always to believe-dd- it is acquired wisdom and experience only that teach incredulity, and they very seldom teach it enough-dd- - adam smith . i put the shotgun in an adidas bag and padded it out with four pairs of tennis socks, not my style at all, but that was what i was aiming for: if they think you're crude, go technical; if they think you're technical, go crude-dd- i'm a very technical boy-dd- so i decided to get as crude as possible-dd- these days, though, you have to be pretty technical before you can even aspire to crudeness-dd- - johnny mnemonic, by william gibson . however, on religious issures there can be little or no compromise-dd- there is no position on which people are so immovable as their religious beliefs-dd- there is no more powerful ally one can claim in a debate than jesus christ, or god, or allah, or whatever one calls this supreme being-dd- but like any powerful weapon, the use of god's name on one's behalf should be used sparingly-dd- the religious factions that are growing throughout our land are not using their religious clout with wisdom-dd- they are trying to force government leaders into following their position 100 percent-dd- if you disagree with these religious groups on a particular moral issue, they complain, they threaten you with a loss of money or votes or both-dd- i'm frankly sick and tired of the political preachers across this country telling me as a citizen that if i want to be a moral person, i must believe in "a," "b," "c," and "d-dd-" just who do they think they are-qq- and from where do they presume to claim the right to dictate their moral beliefs to me-qq- and i am even more angry as a legislator who must endure the threats of every religious group who thinks it has some god-granted right to control my vote on every roll call in the senate-dd- i am warning them today: i will fight them every step of the way if they try to dictate their moral convictions to all americans in the name of "conservatism-dd-" - senator barry goldwater, from the congressional record, september 16, 1981 . "i think every good christian ought to kick falwell's ass-dd-" - senator barry goldwater, when asked what he thought of jerry falwell's suggestion that all good christians should be against sandra day o'connor's nomination to the supreme court . -dd--dd--dd-and no philosophy, sadly, has all the answers-dd- no matter how assured we may be about certain aspects of our belief, there are always painful inconsistencies, exceptions, and contradictions-dd- this is true in religion as it is in politics, and is self-evident to all except fanatics and the naive-dd- as for the fanatics, whose number is legion in our own time, we might be advised to leave them to heaven-dd- they will not, unfortunately, do us the same courtesy-dd- they attack us and each other, and whatever their protestations to peaceful intent, the bloody record of history makes clear that they are easily disposed to restore to the sword-dd- my own belief in god, then, is just that -- a matter of belief, not knowledge-dd- my respect for jesus christ arises from the fact that he seems to have been the most virtuous inhabitant of planet earth-dd- but even well-educated christians are frustated in their thirst for certainty about the beloved figure of jesus because of the undeniable ambiguity of the scriptural record-dd- such ambiguity is not apparent to children or fanatics, but every recognized bible scholar is perfectly aware of it-dd- some christians, alas, resort to formal lying to obscure such reality-dd- - steve allen, comdeian, from an essay in the book "the courage of conviction", edited by philip berman . -dd--dd--dd-it still remains true that as a set of cognitive beliefs about the existence of god in any recognizable sense continuous with the great systems of the past, religious doctrines constitute a speculative hypothesis of an extremely low order of probability-dd- - sidney hook . a fanatic is a person who can't change his mind and won't change the subject-dd- - winston churchill . we're fighting against humanism, we're fighting against liberalism-dd--dd--dd- we are fighting against all the systems of satan that are destroying our nation today-dd--dd--dd-our battle is with satan himself-dd- - jerry falwell . they [preachers] dread the advance of science as witches do the approach of daylight and scowl on the fatal harbinger announcing the subversions of the duperies on which they live-dd- - thomas jefferson . saints should always be judged guilty until they are proven innocent-dd- - george orwell . as i argued in "beloved son", a book about my son brian and the subject of religious communes and cults, one result of proper early instruction in the methods of rational thought will be to make sudden mindless conversions -- to anything -- less likely-dd- brian now realizes this and has, after eleven years, left the sect he was associated with-dd- the problem is that once the untrained mind has made a formal commitment to a religious philosophy -- and it does not matter whether that philosophy is generally reasonable and high-minded or utterly bizarre and irrational -- the powers of reason are suprisingly ineffective in changing the believer's mind-dd- - steve allen, comdeian, from an essay in the book "the courage of conviction", edited by philip berman . nothing is easier than to denounce the evildoer; nothing is more difficult than to understand him-dd- - fyodor dostoevski . we may not be able to persuade hindus that jesus and not vishnu should govern their spiritual horizon, nor moslems that lord buddha is at the center of their spiritual universe, nor hebrews that mohammed is a major prohpet, nor christians that shinto best expresses their spiritual concerns, to say nothing of the fact that we may not be able to get christians to agree among themselves about their relationship to god-dd- but all will agree on a proposition that they possess profound spiritual resources-dd- if, in addition, we can get them to accept the further proposition that whatever form the deity may have in their own theology, the deity is not only external, but internal and acts through them, and they themselves give proof or disproof of the deity in what they do and think; if this further proposition can be accepted, then we come that much closer to a truly religious situation on earth-dd- - norman cousins, from his book "human options" . the messiah will come-dd- there will be a resurrection of the dead -- all the things that jews believed in before they got so damn sophisticated-dd- - rabbi meir kahane . the world is no nursery-dd- - sigmund freud . if one inquires why the american tradition is so strong against any connection of state and church, why it dreads even the rudiments of religious teaching in state-maintained schools, the immediate and superficial answer is not far to seek-dd--dd--dd--dd- the cause lay largely in the diversity and vitality of the various denominations, each fairly sure that, with a fair field and no favor, it could make its own way; and each animated by a jealous fear that, if any connection of state and church were permitted, some rival denomination would get an unfair advantage-dd- - john dewey (1859-1953), american philosopher, from "democracy in the schools", 1908 . already the spirit of our schooling is permeated with the feeling that every subject, every topic, every fact, every professed truth must be submitted to a certain publicity and impartiality-dd- all proffered samples of learning must go to the same assay-room and be subjected to common tests-dd- it is the essence of all dogmatic faiths to hold that any such "show-down" is sacrilegious and perverse-dd- the characteristic of religion, from their point of view, is that it is intellectually secret, not public; peculiarly revealed, not generall known; authoritatively declared, not communicated and tested in ordinary ways-dd--dd--dd-it is pertinent to point out that, as long as religion is conceived as it is now by the great majority of professed religionists, there is something self-contradictory in speaking of education in religion in the same sense in which we speak of education in topics where the method of free inquiry has made its way-dd- the "religious" would be the last to be willing that either the history of the content of religion should be taught in this spirit; while those to whom the scientific standpoint is not merely a technical device, but is the embodiment of the integrity of mind, must protest against its being taught in any other spirit-dd- - john dewey (1859-1953), american philosopher, from "democracy in the schools", 1908 . in the broad and final sense all institutions are educational in the sense that they operate to form the attitudes, dispositions, abilities and disabilities that constitute a concrete personality-dd--dd--dd-whether this educative process is carried on in a predominantly democratic or non- democratic way becomes, therefore, a question of transcendent importance not only for education itself but for its final effect upon all the interests and activites of a society that is committed to the democratic way of life-dd- - john dewey (1859-1953), american philosopher . history shows that the human mind, fed by constant accessions of knowledge, periodically grows too large for its theoretical coverings, and bursts them asunder to appear in new habiliments, as the feeding and growing grub, at intervals, casts its too narrow skin and assumes another-dd--dd--dd- truly the imago state of man seems to be terribly distant, but every moult is a step gained-dd- - charles darwin, from "origin of the species" . -dd--dd--dd-i would go so far as to suggest that, were it not for our ego and concern to be different, the african apes would be included in our family, the hominidae-dd- - richard leakey . it is inconceivable that a judicious observer from another solar system would see in our species -- which has tended to be cruel, destructive, wasteful, and irrational -- the crown and apex of cosmic evolution-dd- viewing us as the culmination of *anything* is grotesque; viewing us as a transitional species makes more sense -- and gives us more hope-dd- - betty mccollister, "our transitional species", free inquiry magazine, vol-dd- 8, no-dd- 1 .

"creation science" has not entered the curriculum for a reason so simple and so basic that we often forget to mention it: because it is false, and because good teachers understand exactly why it is false-dd- what could be more destructive of that most fragile yet most precious commodity in our entire intellectualy heritage -- good teaching -- than a bill forcing honorable teachers to sully their sacred trust by granting equal treatment to a doctrine not only known to be false, but calculated to undermine any general understanding of science as an enterprise-qq- -- stephen jay gould, "the skeptical inquirer", vol-dd- 12, page 186 . it is not well to be thought of as one who meekly submits to insolence and intimidation-dd- .

For a place to be born in, the house is pleasant enough, because on that occasion one makes no great aesthetic demands; instead one begins life screaming at oneâs dear ones, without bothering too much about reasons and circumstances-dd- . Live with purpose-dd- Donât let people or things around you get you down-dd- . Death is a realityâ¦ Life ends definitely when the subject, by his actions, no longer affects his environmentâ¦ He can no longer add an iota to the sum total of his experience-dd- . Sometimes the only thought that sustains me and is my only refuge from despair is that I have always done everything I could within my small power, and that year in, year out, I have never permitted myself any amusements or diversions except those afforded by my studies-dd- . Life is like riding a bicycle-dd- To keep your balance, you must keep moving-dd- . A table, a chair, a bowl of fruit and a violin; what else does a man need to be happy-qq- . On how he sees himself: A person with no roots anywhereâ¦a stranger everywhere-dd- . I am a real lone wolf who has never wholeheartedly belonged to the State, to my country, my circle of friends and not even to my family but who, despite all these bonds, has constantly experienced a feeling of strangeness and the need for solitude-dd- . Be a loner-dd- That gives you time to wonder, to search for the truth-dd- Have holy curiosity-dd- Make your life worth living-dd- . Although I have a regular work schedule, I take time to go for long walks on the beach so that I can listen to what is going on inside my head-dd- If my work isnât going well, I lie down in the middle of a workday and gaze at the ceiling while I listen and visualize what goes on in my imagination-dd- . I am neither a German citizen, nor do I believe in anything that can be described as a âJewish faith-dd-â But I am a Jew and glad to belong to the Jewish people, though I do not regard it in any way as chosen-dd- . My passionate interest in social justice and social responsibility has always stood in curious contrast to a marked lack of desire for direct association with men and women-dd- . I am a horse for single harness, not cut out for tandem or team work-dd- I have never belonged wholeheartedly to country or state, to my circle of friends, or even to my own family-dd- These ties have always been accompanied by a vague aloofness, and the wish to withdraw into myself increases with the years-dd- . When I was young, all I wanted and expected from life was to sit quietly in some corner doing my work without the public paying attention to me-dd- . It is strange to be known so universally and yet to be so lonely-dd- . Solitude can be tolerated only up to a certain limit, you know-dd- . There are two means of refuge from the misery of life â music and cats-dd- . I lived in solitude in the country and noticed how the monotony of a quiet life stimulates the creative mind-dd- . The woman who follows the crowd will usually go no further than the crowd-dd- The woman who walks alone is likely to find herself in places no one has ever been before-dd- . I believe in one thing, that only a life lived for others is a life worth living-dd- . With fame I become more and more stupid, which of course is a very common phenomenon-dd- . Why is it that nobody understands me, yet everybody likes me-qq- . Without deep reflection one knows from daily life that one exists for other people-dd- . I simply enjoy giving more than receiving in every respect, to not take myself nor the doings of the masses seriously, am not ashamed of my weaknesses and vices, and naturally take things as they come with equanimity and humor-dd- Many people are like this, and I really cannot understand why I have been made into a kind of idol-dd- . There is far too great a disproportion between what one is and what others think one is, or at least what they say they think one is-dd- But one has to take it all with good humor-dd- . Of course, understanding of our fellow-beings is important-dd- But this understanding becomes fruitful only when it is sustained by sympathetic feeling in joy and in sorrow-dd- The cultivation of this most important spring of moral action is that which is left of religion when it has been purified of the elements of superstition-dd- . Desire for approval and recognition is a healthy motive, but the desire to be acknowledged as better, stronger or more intelligent than a fellow being or fellow scholar easily leads to an excessively egoistic psychological adjustment-dd- . Many times a day I realize how much my outer and inner life is based upon the labors of my fellow men, both living and dead, and how much I must exert myself in order to give in return as much as I have received-dd- . It is an irony of fate that I myself have been the recipient of excessive admiration and reverence from my fellow-beings, through no fault or merit of my own-dd- . The best way to cheer yourself is to cheer somebody else up-dd- . The high destiny of the individual is to serve rather than to rule-dd- . The only way to escape the corruptible effect of praise is to go on working-dd- . I speak to everyone in the same way, whether he is the garbage man or the president of the university-dd- . Look around at how people want to get more out of life than they put in-dd- A man of value will give more than he receives-dd- . I am content in my later years-dd- I have kept my good humor and take neither myself nor the next person seriously-dd- . Without the sense of fellowship with men of like mind, of preoccupation with the objective, the eternally unattainable in the field of art and scientific research, life would have seemed to me empty-dd- . An awareness of my limitations pervades me all the more keenly in recent times because my faculties have been quite overrated since a few consequences of general relativity theory have stood the test-dd- . A manâs value to the community depends primarily on how far his feelings, thoughts, and actions are directed towards promoting the good of his fellows-dd- . The most important motive for work in school and in life is pleasure in work, pleasure in its result and the knowledge of the value of the result to the community-dd- . Only one who devotes himself to a cause with his whole strength and soul can be a true master-dd- For this reason mastery demands all of a person-dd- . I lack any sentiment of the sort; all I have is a sense of duty toward all people and an attachment to those with whom I have become intimate-dd- . The world is a dangerous place to live, not because of the people who are evil, but because of the people who donât do anything about it-dd- . A manâs ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy, education, and social ties; no religious basis is necessary-dd- Man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hope of reward after death-dd- . Each of us visits this Earth involuntarily, and without an invitation-dd- For me, it is enough to wonder at the secrets-dd- . Be creative, but make sure that what you create is not a curse for mankind-dd- . Love brings much happiness, much more than pining brings pain-dd- . I firmly believe that love [of a subject or hobby] is a better teacher than a sense of duty â at least for me-dd- . Women marry men hoping they will change-dd- Men marry women hoping they will not-dd- So each is inevitably disappointed-dd- . To Mileva Maric: Only the though of you gives my life here a true meaning-dd- . To Mileva Maric: How proud I will be to have a little Ph-dd-D-dd- for a sweetheart-dd- . To Mileva Maric: When you are my dear little wife, we will zealously do scientific work together, so as not to become old philistines, right-qq- My sister seemed to me so philistine-dd- You must never become like that, it would be awful for me-dd- You must always remain my witch and my street urchin-qq--dd- . To Mileva Maric: Just be of good cheer, love, and donât fret-dd- . To Mileva Maric: If only I could give you some of my happiness, so that you would never be sad and wistful-dd- . To Mileva Maric: Donât be angry for my not having written you for so long, I simply havenât much to say that you donât know already-dd- So I help myself out with what always stays lovely and nice-dd- . To Mileva Maric: I am fond of you, my dear girl, and am looking forward to seeing you again on Sunday-dd- We shall again spend an enchanting cozy day together-dd- . To Mileva Maric: I am so lucky to have found you â a creature who is my equal, and who is as strong and independent as I am-dd- . To Mileva Maric: Destiny seems to bear some grudge against the two of us-dd- But this will make things all the more beautiful later on, when all obstacles and worries have been overcome-dd- . To Mileva Maric: But all that doesnât matter-dd- After all, I have you and your love-dd- . To Mileva Maric: How delightful it was the last time, when I was allowed to press your dear little person to me the way nature created it, let me tenderly kiss you for that, you dear good soul-xx- . Letter to Marie Winteler: As to whether I will be patient-qq- What other choice do I have with my beloved, naughty little angle-qq- . Letter to Marie Winteler: You mean more to my soul than the whole world did before, the âinsignificant silly sweetheart that knows nothing and understands nothing-dd-â . Possessing you makes me proud & your love makes me happy-dd- I will be doubly happy when I can press you to my heart again and see your loving eyes-dd- . When you trip over love, it is easy to get up-dd- But when you fall in love, it is impossible to stand again-dd- . Is it not a lack of real affection that scares me away again and again from marriage-dd- Is it a fear of the comfortable life, or nice furniture, of dishonor that I burden myself with, or even the fear of becoming a contented bourgeois-qq- . Marriage makes people treat each other as articles of property and no longer as free human beings-dd- . Marriage is but slavery made to appear civilized-dd- . One must take what nature gives as one finds it-dd- . Joy in looking and comprehending is natureâs most beautiful gift-dd- . How wretchedly inadequate is the theoretical physicist as he stands before Nature, and before his students-dd- . My scientific work is motivated by an irresistible longing to understand the secrets of nature and by no other feelings-dd- My love for justice and the striving to contribute towards the improvement of human conditions are quite independent from my scientific interests-dd- . Look deep into nature, and then you will understand everything better-dd- . The only reason for time is so that everything doesnât happen at once-dd- . (On if his life was a success): Neither on my deathbed nor before will I ask myself such a question-dd- Nature is not an engineer or a contractor, and I myself am a part of Nature-dd- . Occurrences in this domain are beyond the reach of exact prediction because of the variety of factors in operation, not because of any lack of order in nature-dd- . Numerous are the wares that nature produces by the dozen, but her choice products are few-dd- . Space by itself, and time by itself, are doomed to fade away into mere shadows, and only a kind union of the two will preserve an independent reality-dd- . A spirit is manifest in the laws of the universe, a spirit vastly superior to that of man, and one in the face of which we with our modest powers must feel humble-dd- . If the bee disappeared off the surface of the globe, then man would have only four years of life left-dd- No more bees, no more pollination, no more plants, no more animals, no more man-dd- (See Quote Investigator for the source) . I sometimes ask myself how it came about that I was the one to develop the theory of relativity-dd- The reason, I think, is that a normal adult never stops to think about problems of space and time-dd- These are things which he has thought about as a child-dd- . What I see is a certain something, desolate and grey as infinity-dd- I do not believe that the structure of the human brain is to be blamed for the fact that man cannot grasp infinity-dd- . Make a lot of walks to get healthy and donât read that much but save yourself some until youâre grown up-dd- . Reality is merely an illusion, albeit a very persistent one-dd- . A human being is a part of a whole, called by us âuniverseâ, a part limited in time and space-dd- He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the restâ¦ a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness-dd- This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us-dd- Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty-dd- . The most beautiful experience we can have is the mysterious-dd- . Failure and deprivation are the best educators and purifiers-dd- . I do not much believe in education-dd- Each man ought to be his own model, however frightful that may be-dd- . The only thing that you absolutely have to know, is the location of the library-dd- . Combinatory play seems to be the essential feature in productive thought-dd- . That is the way to learn the most, that when you are doing something with such enjoyment that you donât notice that the time passes-dd- . On education: The point is to develop the childlike inclination for play and the childlike desire for recognition and to guide the child over to important fields for society; it is that education which in the main is founded upon the desire for successful activity and acknowledgment-dd- . The aim (of education) must be the training of independently acting and thinking individuals who, however, can see in the service to the community their highest life achievement-dd- . Studying, and striving for truth and beauty in general, is a sphere in which we are allowed to be children throughout life-dd- . Only if outward and inner freedom are constantly and consciously pursued is there a possibility of spiritual development and perfection and thus of improving manâs outward and inner life-dd- . Never regard your study as a duty, but as the enviable opportunity to learn the liberating beauty of the intellect for your own personal joy and for the profit of the community to which your later work will belong-dd- . Schools may favor such freedom by encouraging independent thought-dd- . I believe, indeed, that overemphasis on the purely intellectual attitude, often directed solely to the practical and factual, in our education, has led directly to the impairment of ethical values-dd- . Today also there is an urge toward social progress, toward tolerance and freedom of thought, toward a larger political unityâ¦ But the students at our universities have ceased as completely as their teachers to embody the hopes and ideals of the people-dd- . The most valuable thing a teacher can impart to children is not knowledge and understanding per se but a longing for knowledge and understanding, and an appreciation for intellectual values, whether they be artistic, scientific, or moral-dd- . It is true that my parents were worried because I began to speak relatively late, so much so that they consulted a doctor-dd- I canât say how old I was then, certainly not less than three-dd- . In the matter of physics [education], the first lessons should contain nothing but what is experimental and interesting to see-dd- . When I was a little boy my father showed me a small compass, and the enormous impression that it made on me certainly played a role in my life-dd- . (Part 1) It is not so very important for a person to learn facts-dd- For that he does not really need college-dd- He can learn them from books-dd- . (Part 2) The value of an education in a liberal arts college is not the learning of many facts, but the training of the mind to think something that cannot be learned from textbooks-dd- . Copernicus, through his work and the greatness of his personality, taught man to be modest-dd- . Young people especially like to contemplate bold projects-dd- Also, it is natural for a serious young man to envision his desired goals with the greatest possible precision-dd- . Reading, after a certain age, diverts the mind too much from its creative pursuits-dd- Any man who reads too much and uses his own brain too little falls into lazy habits of thinking-dd- . We will hope that future historians will explain the morbid symptoms of present day society as the childhood ailments of an aspiring humanity, due entirely to the excessive speed at which civilization was advancing-dd- . The students at our universities have ceased as completely as their teachers to enshrine the hopes and ideals of the nation-dd- . Numerous are the academic chairs, but rare are wise and noble teachers-dd- Numerous and large are the lecture halls, but far from numerous the young people who genuinely thirst for truth and justice-dd- . When compared to six yearsâ schooling at a German authoritarian gymnasium, it made me clearly realize how much superior an education based on free action and personal responsibility is to one relying on outward authority-dd- . This is quite natural: everybody likes to do that for which he has a talent-dd- . It is the supreme art of the teacher to awaken joy in creative expression and knowledge-dd- . If you canât explain it to a six year old, you donât understand it yourself-dd- . I am enough of an artist to draw freely upon my imagination-dd- . This delicate little plant [curiosity], aside from stimulation, stands mainly in need of freedom-dd- . I never made one of my discoveries through the process of rational thinking-dd- . True art is characterized by an irresistible urge in the creative artist-dd- . It is a miracle that curiosity survives formal education-dd- . The gift of fantasy has meant more to me than my talent for absorbing positive knowledge-dd- . I very rarely think in words at all-dd- A thought comes, and I may try to express it in words afterwards-dd- . I am certain that it is the mystery of not understanding that attracts people; it impresses them with the aura and magnetism of mystery-dd- . The great moral teachers of humanity were, in a way, artistic geniuses in the art of living-dd- . There is no logical way to the discovery of these elemental laws-dd- There is only the way of intuition, which is helped by a feeling for the order lying behind the appearance-dd- . The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events the firmer becomes his convictions that there is no room left by the side of this ordered regularity for cause of a different nature-dd- . The development of science and of the creative activities of the spirit in general requires still another kind of freedom, which may be characterized as inward freedom-dd- It is this freedom of the spirit which consists in the independence of thought from the restrictions of authoritarian and social prejudices as well as from unphilosophical routinizing and habit in general-dd- . The important thing is not to stop questioning-dd- Curiosity has its own reason for existing-dd- One cannot help but be in awe when one contemplates the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvelous structure of reality-dd- It is enough if one tries to comprehend only a little of this mystery every day-dd- . People like you and me never grow old-dd- We never cease to stand like curious children before the great mystery into which we were born-dd- . The secret to creativity is knowing how to hide your sources-dd- . Music doesnât influence research work, but both are nourished by the same sort of longing, and they complement each other in the satisfaction they offer-dd- . As to Schubert, I have only this to say: play the music, love â and keep you mouth shut-dd- . This is what I have to say about Bachâs life and work: listen, play, love, revere â and keep your mouth shut-dd- . Mozartâs music is so pure and beautiful that I see it as a reflection of the inner beauty of the universe-dd- . I took violin lessons from age 6 to 14, but had no luck with my teachers, for whom music did not transcend mechanical practicing, I really began to learn only when I was about 13 years old, mainly after I had fallen in love with Mozartâs sonatas-dd- . Logic will get you from A to B-dd- Imagination will take you everywhere-dd- . Without creative personalities able to think and judge independently, the upward development of society is as unthinkable as the development of the individual personality without the nourishing soil of the community-dd- . A big fat book full of colored drawings by Japanese children lies always on my table-dd- . A country becomes really a soul only in consciously serving the intellectual life-dd- . The theme that I recognize in Galileoâs work, is the passionate fight against any kind of dogma based on authority-dd- Suspicion against every kind of authority grew out of this experience, an attitude which has never again left me-dd- . Everything that is really great and inspiring is created by the individual who can labor in freedom-dd- . Setting an example is not the main means of influencing another, it is the only means-dd- . Success comes from curiosity, concentration, perseverance and self-criticism-dd- . The ordinary objects of human endeavour â property, outward success, luxury â have always seemed to me contemptible-dd- . Most people stop looking when they find the proverbial needle in the haystack-dd- I would continue looking to see if there were other needles-dd- . The example of great and pure individuals in the only thing that can lead us to noble thoughts and deeds-dd- . If you want to live a happy life, tie it to a goal, not to people or things-dd- . Few are those who see with their own eyes and feel with their own hearts-dd- . Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new-dd- . If the rabble continues to occupy itself with you, then simply donât read that hogwash, but rather leave it to the reptile for whom it has been fabricated-dd- (Letter to Marie Curie about critics) . I think and think for months and years-dd- Ninety-nine times, the conclusion is false-dd- The hundredth time I am right-dd- . I most seriously believe that one does people the best service by giving them some elevating work to do and thus indirectly elevating them-dd- . The attempt to combine wisdom and power has only rarely been successful and then only for a short while-dd- . The true value of a human being is determined primarily by the measure and the sense in which he has attained liberation from the self-dd- . On Mahatma Gandhi after his assassination: Generations to come, it may well be, will scarce believe that such a man as this one ever in flesh and blood walked upon this Earth-dd- . Few people are capable of expressing with equanimity opinions which differ from the prejudices of their social environment-dd- Most people are even incapable of forming such opinions-dd- . A man should look for what is, and not for what he thinks should be-dd- . To make a goal of comfort or happiness has never appealed to me; a system of ethics built on this basis would be sufficient only for a herd of cattle-dd- . Scientists investigate that which already is-dd- . I am not very satisfied with my theory of thermoelectricity-dd- . I never failed in mathematics-dd- Before I was fifteen I had mastered differential and integral calculus-dd- . The whole of science is nothing more than a refinement of everyday thinking-dd- . It is the theory that decides what can be observed-dd- . Everyone who is seriously involved in the pursuit of science becomes convinced that some spirit is manifest in the laws of the universe, one that is vastly superior to that of man-dd- In this way the pursuit of science leads to a religious feeling of a special sort, which is surely quite different from the religiosity of someone more naive-dd- . The scientist find his rewards in what Henri PoincarÃ© calls the joy of comprehension, and not in the possibilities of application to which any discovery may lead-dd- . To his sons: I am actually glad that neither of you dedicated yourselves to science, because it is a hard thing, full of difficult and futile work-dd- . This world is a strange madhouse-dd- Currently, every coachman and every waiter is debating whether relativity theory is correct-dd- . When I have no special problem to occupy my mind, I love to reconstruct proofs of mathematical and physical theorems that have long been known to me-dd- There is no goal in this, merely an opportunity to indulge in the pleasant occupation of thinking-dd- . The real goal of my research has always been the simplification and unification of the system of theoretical physics-dd- . The progress of science presupposes the possibility of unrestricted communications of all results and judgments â freedom of expression and instruction in all realms of intellectual endeavor-dd- . This evening I sat 2 hours at the window and thought about how the law of interaction of molecular forces could be determined-dd- . The process of scientific discovery is, in effect, a continual flight from wonder-dd- . People like us, who believe in physics, know that the distinction between past, present, and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion-dd- . The grand aim of all science is to cover the greatest number of empirical facts by logical deduction from the smallest number of hypotheses or axioms-dd- . Why does this magnificent applied science which saves work and makes life easier bring us so little happiness-qq- The simple answer runs: Because we have not yet learned to make sensible use of it-dd- . In science, moreover, the work of the individual is so bound up with that of his scientific predecessors and contemporaries that it appears almost as an impersonal product of his generation-dd- . It has become appallingly obvious that our technology has exceeded our humanity-dd- . Our entire much-praised technological progress, and civilization generally, could be compared to an axe in the hand of a pathological criminal-dd- . Concern for man and his fate must always form the chief objective of all technological endeavorsâ¦ in order that the creations of our minds shall be a blessing and not a curse to mankind-dd- Never forget this in the midst of your diagrams and equations-dd- . Yes, we have to divide up our time like that, between our politics and our equations-dd- But to me our equations are far more important, for politics are only a matter of present concern-dd- A mathematical equation stands forever-dd- . I assert that the cosmic religious experience is the strongest and the noblest driving force behind scientific research-dd- . Equations are more important to me, because politics is for the present, but an equation is something for eternity-dd- . Pure mathematics is, in its way, the poetry of logical ideas-dd- . I am a deeply religious nonbeliever-dd- This is a somewhat new kind of religion-dd- . Before God we are all equally wise â and equally foolish-dd- . A religious person is devout in the sense that he has no doubt about the significance of those superpersonal objects and goals which neither require nor are capable of rational foundation-dd- . What really interests me is whether God had any choice in the creation of the world-dd- . The further the spiritual evolution of mankind advances, the more certain it seems to me that the path to genuine religiosity does not lie through the fear of life, and the fear of death, and blind faith, but through striving after rational knowledge-dd- . True religion is real living; living with all oneâs soul, with all oneâs goodness and righteousness-dd- . My religion consists of a humble admiration of the illimitable superior spirit who reveals himself in the slight details we are able to perceive with our frail and feeble mind-dd- . My religiosity consists in a humble admiration of the infinitely superior spirit that reveals itself in the little that we, with our weak and transitory understanding, can comprehend of reality-dd- . Through the reading of popular scientific books, I soon reached the conviction that much in the stories of the Bible could not be true-dd- The consequence was a positively fanatic orgy of freethinking coupled with the impression that youth is intentionally being deceived by the state through lies; it was a crushing impression-dd- . Though I am now an old fogey, I am still hard at work and still refuse to believe that God plays dice-dd- . Strenuous intellectual work and looking at Godâs nature are the reconciling, fortifying, yet relentlessly strict angels that shall lead me through all of lifeâs troubles-dd- . God does not care about our mathematical difficulties-dd- He integrates empirically-dd- . We should take care not to make the intellect our God; it has, of course, powerful muscles, but no personality-dd- . I believe in Spinozaâs God, Who reveals Himself in the lawful harmony of the world, not in a God Who concerns Himself with the fate and the doings of mankind-dd- . Try and penetrate with our limited means the secrets of nature and you will find that, behind all the discernible concatenations, there remains something subtle, intangible and inexplicable-dd- Veneration for this force beyond anything that we can comprehend is my religion-dd- To that extent I am, in point of fact, religious-dd- . That deep emotional conviction of the presence of a superior reasoning power, which is revealed in the incomprehensible universe, forms my idea of God-dd- . I cannot imagine a God who rewards and punishes the objects of his creation and is but a reflection of human frailty-dd- . All religions, arts and sciences are branches of the same tree-dd- . Whoever undertakes to set himself up as a judge of Truth and Knowledge is shipwrecked by the laughter of the gods-dd- . God gave me the stubbornness of a mule and a fairly keen scent-dd- . Peace cannot be kept by force-dd- It can only be achieved by understanding-dd- . Only through perils and upheavals can Nations be brought to further developments-dd- May the present upheavals lead to a better world-dd- . I made one great mistake in my life, when I signed the letter to Franklin D-dd- Roosevelt recommending that atom bombs be made-dd- . My pacifism is not based on any intellectual theory but on a deep antipathy to every form of cruelty and hatred-dd- . Every man has a right over his own life and war destroys lives that were full of promise-dd- . I am not only a pacifist but a militant pacifist-dd- I am willing to fight for peace-dd- Nothing will end war unless the people themselves refuse to go to war-dd- . The goal of pacifism is possible only though a supranational organization-dd- To stand unconditionally for this cause is the criterion of true pacifism-dd- . We must begin to inculcate our children against militarism by educating them in the spirit of pacifism-dd- Our schoolbooks glorify war and conceal itâs horror-dd- I would teach peace rather than war-dd- . Today, in twelve countries, young men are resisting conscription and refusing military service-dd- They are the pioneers of a warless world-dd- . He who joyfully marches to music in rank and file has already earned my contempt-dd- He has been given a large brain by mistake, since for him the spinal cord would suffice-dd- . Heroism on command, senseless violence, and all the loathsome nonsense that goes by the name of patriotism â how passionately I hate them-xx- . I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones-dd- . There will be no peace on earth, the wounds inflicted by the war will not heal, until this internationalism is restored-dd- . The release of atomic energy has not created a new problem-dd- It has merely made more urgent the necessity of solving an existing one-dd- . The release of atom power has changed everything except our way of thinkingâ¦ the solution to this problem lies in the heart of mankind-dd- If only I had known, I should have become a watchmaker-dd- . I appeal to all men and women, whether they be eminent or humble, to declare that they will refuse to give any further assistance to war or the preparation of war-dd- . I am not only a pacifist, but a militant pacifist-dd- I am willing to fight for peaceâ¦ Is it not better for a man to die for a cause in which he believes, such as peace, than to suffer for a cause in which he does not believe, such as war-qq- . Relativity applies to physics, not ethics-dd- . Never do anything against conscience, even if the state demands it-dd- . Nationalism is an infantile disease-dd- It is the measles of mankind-dd- . Laws alone can not secure freedom of expression; in order that every man present his views without penalty there must be spirit of tolerance in the entire population-dd- . The most important human endeavor is the striving for morality in our actions-dd- Our inner balance and even our very existence depend on it-dd- Only morality in our actions can give beauty and dignity to life-dd- . One must shy away from questionable undertakings, even when they bear a high-sounding name-dd- . Without âethical cultureâ there is no salvation for humanity-dd- . Fulfillment on the moral and esthetic side is a goal which lies closer to the preoccupations of art than it does to those of science-dd- . In two weeks the sheeplike masses of any country can be worked up by the newspaper into such a state of excited fury that men are prepared to put on uniforms and kill and be killed, for the sake of the sordid ends of a few interested parties-dd- . In politics not only are leaders lacking, but the independence of spirit and the sense of justice of the citizen have to a great extent declined-dd- .
